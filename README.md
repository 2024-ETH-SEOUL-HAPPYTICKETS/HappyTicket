# 🔐💎 The Problem and Our Solution:

Happy Ticket tries to solve common problems in existing web2, web3 event ticketing platforms. We have identified two distinct problems.

The first problem is that when using traditional ticketing solutions, either by paper printed tickets, or digital tickets online, it is hard to prevent malicious actors. Ticket counterfeiting, ticket scalping are issues that harm all participants(artists, audience, organizers) in the entertainment industry.

The second major problem is that although there are countless web3 ticketing solutions that aim to solve the above mentioned problems, there aren’t many Dapps that have survived the years after birth. The majority of the audience attending concerts, exhibitions etc are non-crypto users. Therefore there is a high entry barrier between spectators and web3 platforms.

Happy Ticket service is a comprehensive event ticketing marketplace where tickets are minted as NFTs that are engraved with the information of the initial buyer of the ticket. We implemented a social Open Authentication system provided by a dominant social media in Korea for KYC verification while lowering the psychological barrier of non-crypto Korean users.

This system can be used by event organizers who want to protect their loyal supporters by discouraging excessive secondary trading of tickets and encouraging ethical secondary markets.
